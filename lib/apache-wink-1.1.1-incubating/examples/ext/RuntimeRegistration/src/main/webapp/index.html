<form action="http://localhost:8080/RuntimeRegistration/register" >
Select a resource to add: 
<select name="class">
	<option
		value="org.apache.wink.example.registration.AtomHelloWorldResource">Hello
	World (atom)</option>
	<option value="org.apache.wink.example.registration.HelloWorldResource" />Hello
	World (text)</option>
</select><br />
<input type="submit" title="Add Resource" value="Add Resource" /></form>
<p>A resource can be registered many times, 
it won't actually effect the system, but a warning will be printed to log.
<p>
<hr/>
The following links lead to the resources:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/RuntimeRegistration/rest/atom">Hello World (atom)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/RuntimeRegistration/rest/world">Hello World (text)</a></li>
</ul>
Prior to registering resources these links will be broken (will return 404 Not Found).<br/>
